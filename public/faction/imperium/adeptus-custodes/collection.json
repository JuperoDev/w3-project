Known as the Ten Thousand, they are the most elite warriors in the entire Imperium, and are armed and armoured to match. In battle, they deploy highly flexible fighting forces, from peerless infantry and lightning-fast jetbikes to indomitable combat walkers and line-shattering battle tanks. It is in melee combat that they truly excel, however, each warrior having mastered the nuanced and subtle fighting stances designed to dominate the Custodians’ many enemies.",

While a Ka’tah Stance is active for your army, each unit from your army with this ability gains the relevant ability. <br/> <br/> <strong>Kaptaris Stance </strong><br/> <p class ='italic'> Kaptaris is optimised to trap enemy units in close combat with the Custodes, where the elite warriors can eliminate them. </p> <p>Each time a melee attack targets this unit, subtract 1 from the Hit roll. </p>  <br/> <br/> <strong>Dacatarai Stance </strong><br/>  <p class ='italic'> This aggressive fighting style has been adapted for the Custodes to deal with hordes of foes who vastly outnumber them. </p> <p>Melee weapons equipped by models in this unit have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability. </p>    <br/>  <strong>Rendax Stance </strong><br/> <p class ='italic'> Masters of Rendax are superlative monster and warmachine hunters. </p> <p>Melee weapons equipped by models in this unit have the [LETHAL HITS] ability.</p>  "
