When the Angels of Death strike, they do so with the precision of a surgeon and the force of a thunderbolt. Experience and strategic expertise help them to read the shifting shape of the battle with post-human speed and clarity, directing their wrath towards one priority target after another. Command assets are annihilated, leaving the enemy reeling leaderless. Heavy armour, potent artillery and the vaunted elites of the foe’s forces are laid waste with horrifying speed, until the Emperor’s Angels of Death stand victorious over a field of smouldering wreckage and bolt-riddled corpses, and honour is finally satisfied.",

Until the start of your next Command phase, that enemy unit is your Oath of Moment target. Each time a model with this ability makes an attack that targets your Oath of Moment target, you can re-roll the Hit roll."
