            "description": "<p> If your Army Faction is <strong>THOUSAND SONS</strong>, at the end of your Command phase, each model from your army with this ability that is on the battlefield (excluding Battle-shocked models) generates you a number of Cabal points equal to the number shown in its ability (e.g. a model with the Cabal of Sorcerers 2 ability would generate you 2 Cabal points). The combined total of these is your Cabal points pool. During the battle round, you can use Rituals from the list below, deducting the Cabal points cost of each one from your Cabal points pool. If you do not have enough Cabal points for a Ritual, you cannot use it. Each Ritual can only be used once per phase. At the start of your next Command phase, your Cabal points pool resets to zero. Each time you use a Ritual, select one <strong>THOUSAND SONS PSYKER</strong> model from your army, then apply that Ritual’s effect using that <strong>PSYKER</strong>. </p> <br/>   <br/> <p> <strong>WEAVER OF FATES (PSYCHIC)</strong> </p> <hr/> </p><strong>2 Cabal Points</strong></p><p> Use this Ritual at the start of any phase. Once during that phase, when a saving throw is failed for a friendly THOUSAND SONS model whose unit is within 18'' of this PSYKER, you can re-roll that saving throw.</p> <br/>        <p> <strong>TEMPORAL SURGE (PSYCHIC)</strong> </p> <hr/> </p><strong>5 Cabal Points</strong></p><p> Use this Ritual at the start of your Shooting phase. Select one friendly THOUSAND SONS unit within 18'' of this PSYKER; unless that unit is within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units, it can make a Normal move. If it does, that unit is not eligible to declare a charge this turn.</p> <br/>      <p> <strong>ECHOES FROM THE WARP (PSYCHIC)</strong> </p> <hr/> </p><strong>6 Cabal Points</strong></p><p>Use this Ritual at the start of any phase. Once this phase, you can select this PSYKER’s unit as the target of a Stratagem for 0CP, even if you have already used that Stratagem this phase.</p> <br/>     <p> <strong>DOOMBOLT (PSYCHIC)</strong> </p> <hr/> </p><strong>7 Cabal Points</strong></p><p> Use this Ritual at the start of your Shooting phase. Select one enemy unit within 18'' of and visible to this PSYKER and roll one D6: on a 1, that enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds; on a 2-5, it suffers D3+3 mortal wounds; on a 6, it suffers D3+6 mortal wounds.</p> <br/>    <p> <strong>TWIST OF FATE (PSYCHIC)</strong> </p> <hr/> </p><strong>9 Cabal Points</strong></p><p> Use this Ritual at the start of any phase. Select one enemy unit within 18'' of and visible to this PSYKER; until the end of the phase, armour saving throws cannot be made for models in that unit.</p> <br/> "
