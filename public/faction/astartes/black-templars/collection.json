    "description": "The Black Templars are valiant warrior-knights and pious champions of the Emperor. They are deeply unusual among the Adeptus Astartes for venerating the Emperor as a literal god. The Chapter's fanatical devotion finds its focus in constant campaigning. A fleet-based Chapter, they divide their forces into crusades led by Marshals, and storm across the galaxy immolating and annihilating everything that stands in their path.",
