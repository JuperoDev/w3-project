      <h3 id="section1" class="menu-holder__header">CORE CONCEPTS</h3>
    <h5>
      This section introduces various rules terms that you will find throughout
      the Core Rules and beyond. These key concepts form the basis of the
      Warhammer 40,000 rules, and are essential for every kind of battle.
    </h5>
    <h4>MISSIONS</h4>
    <p>
      To play a game of Warhammer 40,000, you must first select a mission. The
      mission will tell you how to muster your armies, create your battlefield
      and deploy your forces on the tabletop. It will also tell you any special
      rules that apply to the battle, and (most importantly!) what you need to
      do to win. You can find out more about missions here.
    </p>
    <h4>ARMIES</h4>
    <p>
      Each player in a game of Warhammer 40,000 commands an army of Citadel
      miniatures, hereafter referred to as models. The mission you have selected
      will guide you as to how big your army should be.
    </p>

    <div class="menu-holder_highlight">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Army:</b> All of the models under your command.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>Units</h4>
    <p>
      Models move and fight in units. A unit can have one or more models from a
      single datasheet (see below). Models and units from the same army are said
      to be friendly in relation to each other. Models and units from your
      opponent’s army are referred to as enemy models and units. If a rule
      affects ‘models’ or ‘units’ without specifying that they are friendly or
      enemy, that rule affects all models or all units, regardless of whose army
      they are in.
    </p>

    <div class="menu-holder_highlight">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Unit:</b> One or more models from the same datasheet.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Friendly Models/Units:</b> All models/units from the same army.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Enemy Models/Units:</b> All models/units from your opponent’s army.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h4>Datasheets</h4>
    <p>
      The rules you will need to use your models in games are presented on
      datasheets. Each unit has a datasheet; you will need the datasheets for
      all the units from your army. You can find out more about datasheets here.
    </p>

    <h4>KEYWORDS</h4>
    <p>
      All datasheets have a list of keywords, separated into Faction keywords
      and other keywords. Faction keywords can be used to help you decide which
      models to include in your army, but otherwise both sets of keywords are
      functionally the same. In either case, keywords appear in KEYWORD BOLD.
      Keywords are sometimes linked to (or ‘tagged’ by) a rule. For example, a
      rule might say that it applies to INFANTRY units. This means it only
      applies to units that have the INFANTRY keyword on their datasheet. The
      pluralisation (or otherwise) of keywords does not affect which units the
      rule in question applies to.
    </p>

    <h4>Engagement Range</h4>
    <p>
      Engagement Range represents the zone of threat that models present to
      their enemies. While a model is within 1" horizontally and 5" vertically
      of an enemy model, those models – and their units – are within Engagement
      Range of each other.
    </p>

    <p>
      Models cannot be set up or end a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move within
      Engagement Range of any enemy models. If for any reason a model cannot
      meet this condition, that model is destroyed.
    </p>
    <div class="menu-holder_highlight">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Engagement Range:</b> Within 1" horizontally and 5" vertically.
        </li>

        <li>Models cannot be set up or end a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move
          within Engagement Range of any enemy models.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="high-light-area">
      <h4>UNIT COHERENCY</h4>

      <p>
        A unit that contains more than one model must be set up and end any kind of move as a single group, with all of its models within 2" horizontally and 5" vertically of at least one other model from that unit. While a unit has seven or more models, all of its models must instead be set up and end any kind of move within 2" horizontally and 5" vertically of at least two other models from that unit. This is called Unit Coherency.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        If for any reason a model cannot be set up in Unit Coherency, that model is destroyed. If a unit cannot end a move in Unit Coherency, it cannot make that move and its models are returned to their previous positions.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        At the end of every turn, each player must remove models, one at a time, from any of the units from their armies that are no longer in
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Unit Coherency, until only a single group of models from each of those units remains in play and in Unit Coherency. Models removed in this way count as having been destroyed, but they never trigger any rules that apply when a model is destroyed.
      </p>


      <div class="menu-holder_highlight">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Unit Coherency: </b> Within 2" horizontally and 5" vertically of:
            <p>- One other model from the same unit (in units of 2-6 models).</p>
            <p>- Two other models from the same unit (in units of 7+ models).</p>
          </li>
<br/>
          <li>At the end of every turn, if a unit is not in Unit Coherency, the controlling player must remove models until that unit is in Unit Coherency again.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="menu-holder__subtitles--red-square"><p>A</p></div><p>Each model in this Sternguard Veterans unit of five models is within 2" of at least one other model in the unit. This unit is therefore in Unit Coherency.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Battlefield</h4>
    <p>
      Battles of Warhammer 40,000 are fought on rectangular battlefields. This can be any surface upon which the models can stand – a dining table, for example, or the floor. Your mission will guide you as to the size of battlefield required.
    </p>

    <h5>Terrain Features</h5>
    <p>
      The scenery on a battlefield can be represented by models from the Warhammer 40,000 range. These models are called terrain features to differentiate them from the models that make up an army. Terrain features are set up on the battlefield before the battle begins. You can find out more about terrain features here.
    </p>

    <p>Unless the mission you are playing instructs you otherwise, you should feel free to create an exciting battlefield using any terrain features from your collection.
</p>


<h4>Measuring Distances</h4>

<p>Distances in Warhammer 40,000 are measured in inches ("). You can measure distances whenever you wish.</p>

<p>When measuring the distance between models, measure between the closest points of the bases of the models you’re measuring to and from. If a model does not have a base, measure to the closest point of any part of that model instead.</p>

<p>If a rule says it applies ‘within’ a certain distance, it applies at any distance that is not more than the specified distance. For example, within 1" means any distance that is not more than 1" away.</p>

<div class="menu-holder_highlight text-cyan-700">
  <h5 class="italic">Hints and Tips</h5>
  <h5>Wobbly Models</h5>
  <p class="italic">Sometimes you may find that a particular terrain feature makes it hard for you to place a model exactly where you want to. If you delicately balance a model in place, it is very likely to fall as soon as someone nudges the table, leaving your painted model damaged or even broken. In cases like this, provided it is still physically possible to place the model in the desired location, you may find it helps to leave a model in a safer position, provided both players agree and know its ‘actual’ location. If, later on, an enemy model is shooting the model, you will have to hold it back in place so that visibility can be determined.</p>
