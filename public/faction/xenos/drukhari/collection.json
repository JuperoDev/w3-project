"description": "The Drukhari are a race of sadistic killers who feed upon the exquisite agony of their victims. From the Dark City of Commorragh, hidden deep within the twisting passages of the webway, their reaver-fleets strike forth in a never-ending search for new souls to torment.",

        "lore": "The Drukhari are experts in precise torture, sharp blades, cruel poisons and eldritch abominations. Using the labyrinthine network of webway spars, they strike almost anywhere. Realspace raiding parties prey upon worlds across the galaxy, surging from hidden portals unknown to those they see merely as cattle or playthings. As the Drukhari feed on the souls of the slain, they become imbued with supernatural might, eventually turning into killing machines.",
