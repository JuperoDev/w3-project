    <h5>
      This section introduces various rules terms that you will find throughout
      the Core Rules and beyond. These key concepts form the basis of the
      Warhammer 40,000 rules, and are essential for every kind of battle.
    </h5>
    <h4>MISSIONS</h4>
    <p>
      To play a game of Warhammer 40,000, you must first select a mission. The
      mission will tell you how to muster your armies, create your battlefield
      and deploy your forces on the tabletop. It will also tell you any special
      rules that apply to the battle, and (most importantly!) what you need to
      do to win. You can find out more about missions here.
    </p>
    <h4>ARMIES</h4>
    <p>
      Each player in a game of Warhammer 40,000 commands an army of Citadel
      miniatures, hereafter referred to as models. The mission you have selected
      will guide you as to how big your army should be.
    </p>

    <div class="menu-holder_highlight">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Army:</b> All of the models under your command.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>Units</h4>
    <p>
      Models move and fight in units. A unit can have one or more models from a
      single datasheet (see below). Models and units from the same army are said
      to be friendly in relation to each other. Models and units from your
      opponent’s army are referred to as enemy models and units. If a rule
      affects ‘models’ or ‘units’ without specifying that they are friendly or
      enemy, that rule affects all models or all units, regardless of whose army
      they are in.
    </p>

    <div class="menu-holder_highlight">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Unit:</b> One or more models from the same datasheet.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Friendly Models/Units:</b> All models/units from the same army.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Enemy Models/Units:</b> All models/units from your opponent’s army.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h4>Datasheets</h4>
    <p>
      The rules you will need to use your models in games are presented on
      datasheets. Each unit has a datasheet; you will need the datasheets for
      all the units from your army. You can find out more about datasheets here.
    </p>

    <h4>KEYWORDS</h4>
    <p>
      All datasheets have a list of keywords, separated into Faction keywords
      and other keywords. Faction keywords can be used to help you decide which
      models to include in your army, but otherwise both sets of keywords are
      functionally the same. In either case, keywords appear in KEYWORD BOLD.
      Keywords are sometimes linked to (or ‘tagged’ by) a rule. For example, a
      rule might say that it applies to INFANTRY units. This means it only
      applies to units that have the INFANTRY keyword on their datasheet. The
      pluralisation (or otherwise) of keywords does not affect which units the
      rule in question applies to.
    </p>

    <h4>Engagement Range</h4>
    <p>
      Engagement Range represents the zone of threat that models present to
      their enemies. While a model is within 1" horizontally and 5" vertically
      of an enemy model, those models – and their units – are within Engagement
      Range of each other.
    </p>

    <p>
      Models cannot be set up or end a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move within
      Engagement Range of any enemy models. If for any reason a model cannot
      meet this condition, that model is destroyed.
    </p>
    <div class="menu-holder_highlight">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Engagement Range:</b> Within 1" horizontally and 5" vertically.
        </li>

        <li>Models cannot be set up or end a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move
          within Engagement Range of any enemy models.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="hight-ligt-area">
      <h4>UNIT COHERENCY</h4>

      <p>
        A unit that contains more than one model must be set up and end any kind of move as a single group, with all of its models within 2" horizontally and 5" vertically of at least one other model from that unit. While a unit has seven or more models, all of its models must instead be set up and end any kind of move within 2" horizontally and 5" vertically of at least two other models from that unit. This is called Unit Coherency.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        If for any reason a model cannot be set up in Unit Coherency, that model is destroyed. If a unit cannot end a move in Unit Coherency, it cannot make that move and its models are returned to their previous positions.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        At the end of every turn, each player must remove models, one at a time, from any of the units from their armies that are no longer in
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Unit Coherency, until only a single group of models from each of those units remains in play and in Unit Coherency. Models removed in this way count as having been destroyed, but they never trigger any rules that apply when a model is destroyed.
      </p>


      <div class="menu-holder_highlight">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Unit Coherency: </b> Within 2" horizontally and 5" vertically of:
            <p>- One other model from the same unit (in units of 2-6 models).</p>
            <p>- Two other models from the same unit (in units of 7+ models).</p>
          </li>
<br/>
          <li>At the end of every turn, if a unit is not in Unit Coherency, the controlling player must remove models until that unit is in Unit Coherency again.
          </li>
        </ul>

<!-- BATTLE ROUND  -->
    <div class="section__battle-round">
      <h3 id="section2" class="menu-holder__header">The Battle Round</h3>
    <h5>
      Warhammer 40,000 is played in a series of battle rounds. In each battle round, both players have a turn. The same player always takes the first turn in each battle round – the mission you are playing will tell you which player this is. Each turn consists of a series of phases, which must be resolved in the following order.
    </h5>

    <h4>Command</h4>
    <p>
      At the start of your Command phase, before doing anything else, both players gain 1CP. Command points are a strategic resource that you can spend during the battle to use Stratagems.
    </p>

    <p>Then, if you have any other rules that need to be resolved in the Command phase, you do so now before progressing to the Battle-shock step.</p>

    <div class="menu-holder_highlight">
      <ul>
        <li>Both players gain 1CP.</li>
        <li>Resolve any other rules that occur in the Command phase.</li>
      </ul>
