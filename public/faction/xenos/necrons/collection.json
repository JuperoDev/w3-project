Should a Necron be slain, its body becomes wreathed in an eerie glow. Crawling limbs reattach. Sundered torsos and smashed skulls reform amidst emerald sparks. Witch lights flare back to life within dead eye-lenses and the Necron rises again, shambling back into their battle line. Those Necrons too catastrophically damaged to reform vanish instead, teleported away to their tombs for repair.",
            "description": "If your Army Faction is <strong>NECRONS</strong>, at the end of your Command phase, each unit from your army with this ability that is on the battlefield activates its Reanimation Protocols and reanimates D3 wounds. Each time such a unit reanimates a wound: <br/> <li>If that unit contains one or more models with fewer than their starting number of wounds remaining, select one of those models; that model regains one lost wound </li>  <li>If all models in that unit have their starting number of wounds, but that unit is not at its Starting Strength, one destroyed model is returned to that unit with one wound remaining. </li> <br/> <p>Once such a unit is at its Starting Strength and all of its models have their starting number of wounds, nothing further happens. </p>"
