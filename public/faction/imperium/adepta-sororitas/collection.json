    "description": "The Adepta Sororitas, also known as the Sisters of Battle, are an elite sisterhood of warriors raised from infancy to believe unquestioningly in the supreme power of the Emperor of Mankind. The perfervid, unshakeable nature of their faith is a potent weapon indeed, manifesting as divine inspiration that drives the Sisters of Battle to incredible feats of martial prowess. Their fanatical devotion and unwavering purity are a bulwark against corruption, heresy and alien attack, and once battle has been joined they will stop at nothing until their enemies are utterly crushed.",
