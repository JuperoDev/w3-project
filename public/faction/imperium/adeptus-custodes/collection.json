Known as the Ten Thousand, they are the most elite warriors in the entire Imperium, and are armed and armoured to match. In battle, they deploy highly flexible fighting forces, from peerless infantry and lightning-fast jetbikes to indomitable combat walkers and line-shattering battle tanks. It is in melee combat that they truly excel, however, each warrior having mastered the nuanced and subtle fighting stances designed to dominate the Custodians’ many enemies.",
