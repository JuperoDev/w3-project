    "description": "Throughout the Imperium there exist numerous martial organisations and shadowy institutions. Bodies of armed warriors or solitary agents from these groups possess specialist skills, unusual equipment and vested interests that lead them to be attached to larger Imperial armies. Some are requisitioned by the armyâ€™s commander for their particular abilities, others are assigned by their hidden masters to achieve singular agendas. The most powerful have the authority and reputation to enforce their presence on the field of battle.",
