When they finally emerge to fight, it is after long years of meticulous planning, and with an intimate knowledge of the battlefield that grants them a tactical advantage. Even as battle rages, reinforcements slip from the shadows or spill up from the dark places below, called to war by the Broodmind.",
            "description": "If your Army Faction is <strong>GENESTEALER CULTS</strong>, each time a unit with this ability is destroyed, roll one D6, adding 1 to the result if it is a BATTLELINE unit, and adding 1 to the result if it is the first or second battle round. On a 5+, add a new unit to your army identical to your destroyed unit, in Cult Ambush, at its Starting Strength and with all of its wounds remaining, and you can place one Cult Ambush marker* anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9'' horizontally away from all enemy units (if this is not possible, no marker is placed) <br/> <br/> If an enemy model (excluding<strong> AIRCRAFT</strong> models) ends any kind of move within 9'' of a Cult Ambush marker you placed, that Cult Ambush marker is removed from the battlefield. At the end of the Reinforcements step of your opponentâ€™s next Movement phase, for each of your Cult Ambush markers that is still on the battlefield, you can select one unit from your army that is in Cult Ambush and set up that unit on the battlefield more than 9'' horizontally away from all enemy models and with at least one model in that unit touching that Cult Ambush marker and all other models placed wholly within 3'' of that Cult Ambush marker (that Cult Ambush marker is then removed from the battlefield). <br/> <br/>  <strong>CHARACTERS</strong> that are attached to a unit with this ability are not returned alongside that unit should it return to the battlefield as described above (only the Bodyguard unit returns). <br/> <br/> <i>* A circular 32mm diameter marker should be used for Cult Ambush Markers. </i>"
